Soul_Bank
=========

I created a banking code as a personal project to teach me Java.

When done, it will have a full menu system, which allows a user to create an account, login with a password, create repositories, check balances, deposit/transfer/extract from souls from their repositories, close their accounts and repositories and a little more.
Also, there will also be an administrator who can log in and will similarly be able to create accounts, repositories, transfer souls between a customers accounts and close accounts with several limits to avoid abuse.
Accounts and repositories are persistent using of a set of text files.  Along with a log of all of the user actions.
